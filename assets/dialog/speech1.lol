I've never had the chance to visit that nearby city. That'd be nice.
The city south of here is ENORMOUS! I could never live there.
The city to the southeast is so big!
I once saw a dragon fly over our town!
These apples are delicious!
I love the taste of these apples!
I've never been to the north. The monsters are just too vicious.
The city to the south doesn't have as many monsters to deal with.
